On the Select Target for Sensitive Data Discovery page, select your target database, and then click Continue.

![alt text](./images/img04.png " ")

On the Select **Sensitive Data Model** page, leave **Create** selected, enter **SDM_HCM** for the name, enable **Show and save sample data**, select the **Compartment** assigned for the workshop, and then click **Continue**.

![alt text](./images/img05.png " ")

On the **Select Schemas for Sensitive Data Discovery** page, scroll down and select the **HCM** schema, and then click **Continue**.

![alt text](./images/img06.png " ")

On the **Select Sensitive Types for Sensitive Data Discovery** page, expand all of the categories by moving the slider to the right, and then scroll down the page and review the sensitive types. Notice that you can select individual sensitive types, sensitive categories, and all sensitive types.

At the top of the page, select the **Select All** check box, and then click **Continue** to start the data discovery job.

![alt text](./images/img07.png " ")

When the job is completed, ensure that the **Detail** column states Data discovery job finished successfully, and then click **Continue**.

![alt text](./images/img08.png " ")

On the **Sensitive Data Discovery Result** page, examine the sensitive data model created by the Data Discovery wizard. To view all of the sensitive columns, move the **Expand All** slider to the right.
Oracle Data Safe automatically saves your sensitive data model to the Oracle Data Safe Library.

![alt text](./images/img09.png " ")

From the drop-down list, select **Schema View** to sort the sensitive columns by table.

![alt text](./images/img10.png " ")

Scroll down the page to view the sensitive columns.
You can view sample data (if it's available for a sensitive column), column counts, and estimated data counts.
In particular, take a look at the sensitive columns that Data Discovery found in the **EMPLOYEES** table. Columns that do not have a check mark are called referential relationships. They are included because they have a relationship to another sensitive column and that relationship is defined in the database's data dictionary.
Also view the sample data provided to get an idea of what the sensitive data looks like.

![alt text](./images/img11.png " ")

Scroll to the bottom of the page, and then click **Report** to view the Data Discovery report.
The chart compares sensitive categories. You can view totals of sensitive values, sensitive types, sensitive tables, and sensitive columns.
The table displays individual sensitive column names, sample data for the sensitive columns, column counts based on sensitive categories, and estimated data counts.

![alt text](./images/img12.png " ")

Click the chart's Expand button.

![alt text](./images/img13.png " ")

Position your mouse over **Identification Info** to view statistics.

![alt text](./images/img14.png " ")

With your mouse still over **Identification Info**, click the **Expand** button to drill down.

![alt text](./images/img15.png " ")

Notice that the **Identification** Info category is divided into two smaller categories (**Personal IDs** and **Public IDs**). To drill-up, position your mouse over an expanded sensitive category, and then click the **Collapse** button.

![alt text](./images/img16.png " ")

Click the **Close** button (**X**) to close the expanded chart.

![alt text](./images/img17.png " ")

## STEP 2: Create a full clone of your ATP-S instance

Let's consider we want to mask sensitive data in a clone of our Autonomous Database before performing some tests.

From the main hamburger menu in the OCI console, go to the Autonomous Database section and select your ATP-S instance.

In the **More Actions** menu of the details page, select **Create clone**.

![alt text](./images/img36.png " ")

Create a full clone with the following options:

* Clone type : full clone
* Clone source : clone from database instance
* Compartment : keep value
* Source database name : ATP-[your-name]
* Display Name : **ATP-[your-name]2**
* Database Name : **ATP[your-initials]2**
* DB version : 19c
* CPU Core Count : 1
* Storage (TB) : 1
* Auto scaling : **Leave Unchecked**
* Password : **OraclePTS#2020**
* Network access : Leave default selection (Allow secure access from everywhere)
* License Type : BYOL (My Organization Already owns Oracle Database…)

This process will take around 10 minutes to complete.

## STEP 3: Register the cloned database to Data Safe

In order to mask its sensitive data, we now need to register the cloned database to Data Safe.

Please replicate the steps in **lab 2** and do not forget to run the following SQL as **ADMIN**:

````
<copy>
EXECUTE DS_TARGET_UTIL.GRANT_ROLE('DS$DATA_DISCOVERY_ROLE');
EXECUTE DS_TARGET_UTIL.GRANT_ROLE('DS$DATA_MASKING_ROLE');
EXECUTE DS_TARGET_UTIL.GRANT_ROLE('DS$AUDIT_SETTING_ROLE'); 
</copy>
````

## STEP 4: Mask sensitive data by using Data Masking


We are now ready to mask the sensitive data in our cloned database.

The Data Masking wizard will help us to create a masking policy for the target database based on the sensitive data model created earlier.

Select **Data Masking** from the **Home** menu. Select your cloned database and click **Continue**.

![alt text](./images/img18.png " ")

Choose to create a new masking policy:

*	Making policy : **Create**
*	Masking policy name : **MASK_HCM**
*	Sensitive Data Modile : **Pick from Library**
*	Compartment : select the **compartment** assigned to the workshop

![alt text](./images/img19.png " ")

On the **Select Sensitive Data Model** page, select **SDM_HCM** and make sure “Update the SDM with the target”  is selected. Click **Continue**.

![alt text](./images/img20.png " ")

On the **Sensitive Data Model: SDM_HCM** page, click on View Sensitive Columns

![alt text](./images/img21.png " ")

Make sure all sensitive columns are selected and click **Save and Continue**.

![alt text](./images/img22.png " ")

Move the **Expand All** slider to the right to view all of the sensitive columns. Scroll down the page to view the default masking format selected for each sensitive column.

For instance, **FIRST_NAME** will be masked by selecting a **Random Name**

Click the arrow to the right of the masking format to view other available masking formats.

![alt text](./images/img25.png " ")

Next to the arrow, click the Edit Format button (pencil icon).

![alt text](./images/img26.png " ")

In the **Edit Format** dialog box, view the description, examples, and default configuration for the masking format.
This is where you can modify a masking format.

Click **Cancel**.

At the bottom of the page, click **Confirm Policy**, and then wait a moment while Data Masking creates the masking policy.

![alt text](./images/img27.png " ")

On the **Schedule** the Masking Job page, leave **Right Now** selected, and then click **Review**.

![alt text](./images/img28.png " ")

On the **Review and Submit** page, review the information, and then click **Submit** to start the data masking job.

![alt text](./images/img29.png " ")

Wait for the data masking job to finish. It takes a couple of minutes. You can follow the status of the job on the **Masking Jobs** page. When the job is completed successfully, click **Report**.

![alt text](./images/img30.png " ")

Examine the **Data Masking** report.

The report shows you how many values, sensitive types, tables, and columns were masked.
For each sensitive column, the report shows you a sample masked value (if available), the masking format used, and the number of rows masked.

The table also shows you column counts for the sensitive categories and types.

![alt text](./images/img31.png " ")

Click Generate Report.

![alt text](./images/img32.png " ")

In the **Generate Report** dialog box, leave **PDF** selected, enter **HCM Masking**  for the description, ensure the right **Compartment** is selected, and then click **Generate Report**.

![alt text](./images/img33.png " ")

Wait for the report to generate. When it's generated, click Download Report.
Review the report, and then close it.

![alt text](./images/img34.png " ")

## STEP 5: View masked data in SQL Developer

Now you can use SQL Developer again yo view the anonymized data in the HCM schema.
