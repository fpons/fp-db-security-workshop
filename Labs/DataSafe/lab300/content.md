## Requirements ##

To complete this lab, you need to have the following:
* Login credentials and a tenancy name for the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console
* A compartment enabled with permission to create and use resources
* The ATP-S instance provisioned in Lab 1
* The access privileges configured in Lab 2

## STEP 1: Provision audit and alert policies on a target database by using the Activity Auditing wizard

In the Oracle Data Safe Console, click the **Home** tab, and then click the **Activity Auditing** tab.

On the **Select Targets for Auditing** page, select the check box for your target database, and then click **Continue**.

On the **Retrieve Audit Policies** page, select the check box for your target database, and then click **Retrieve** to retrieve the audit policies for your database. Wait until a green check mark is displayed in the Retrieval Status column, and then click **Continue**.

Click **continue** to reach the **Review and Provision Audit and Alert Policies** page.

Click on the name of your database to open the Edit Policies dialog box.

On the **Audit Policies** tab in the Edit Policies dialog box, notice that the following Basic Auditing and Admin Activity Auditing policies are selected by default. Oracle recommends that you provision these policies. They are not provisioned by default.

*	Critical Database Activity
*	Login Events
*	Database Schema Changes (DDL)
*	Admin Activity

Expand **Oracle Pre-defined Policies** to view the list of Oracle predefined audit policies available on your ATP database. By default, the following policies are provisioned:

Provision the following additional policies:

Also the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Configuration policy is not provisioned and enabled by default. Check to enable it, then click **Provision**.

You can click the **Alert Policies** tab to review the selected alert policies.

![alt text](./images/img10.png " ")

On the **Review and Provision Audit and Alert Policies** page, wait for check marks to appear under all audit policy types, except for All User Activity, and then click **Continue**.

![alt text](./images/img11.png " ")

On the **Start Audit Collection** page, notice the following defaults:

*	The audit trail location is automatically set to UNIFIED\_AUDIT\_TRAIL
*	Audit collection is not yet started.
*	The auto purge feature is enabled.

Click on the "Collect Audit Data From" icon and choose to select audit data from "today".

Select your database and click **Start** to start collecting audit data.

A message at the top of the page states the **UNIFIED\_AUDIT\_TRAIL** is successfully created.

The Collection State column indicates that collection is **LOADING**, then **STARTING**, and then **COLLECTING**.

![alt text](./images/img13.png " ")

While the audit data is being collected, click **Done**.

## STEP 3: Execute some account management activity on the database

Using SQL Developer, disconnect from **ADMIN**, then connect again and execute the following statements:

````
<copy>
create user bob identified by "OraclePTS#2020";
grant DWROLE to bob;
drop user bob;
</copy>
````

New auditing policies do not take effect until after the audited users (or users who have been granted the roles associated with the policy) log into the database instance. For this reason, you should disconnect as ADMIN and reconnect before executing the above statements so that they can be captured by our recently created audit policies.

## STEP 4: View audited activity in Data Safe

Connect to the Data Safe console.

Click on the **Reports** tab.

In the **Auditing Activity** category on the left hand side, select the **All Activity** report.

The user creation records are shown after one or two minutes:

Continue with Lab 4.
