## Requirements ##

To complete this lab, you need to have the following:
*	Login credentials and a tenancy name for the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console
* A compartment enabled with permission to create and use resources
*	The ATP-S instance provisioned in Lab 1

## STEP 1: Register to Data Safe


The Data Safe service has already been enabled for your tenancy and region.
However, it is still necessary to register an ATP-S instance before it can be managed by Data Safe.
From the OCI console, navigate to the details of your Autonomous Database instance and click on Register in the Data Safe section at the right bottom of the page.

## STEP 2: Grant Roles for the Oracle Data Safe Service Account


Data Safe uses a pre-created ATP user (DS$ADMIN) that is enabled when the instance is registered.
The features that you can use depend on the roles granted to the Oracle Data Safe service account on that target database.
Note that some basic roles are granted by default, allowing ADMIN to run simple security and user assessments.


To enable all other Data Safe features, connect to ATP-S with SQL Developer as user **ADMIN** and execute the following GRANTs:

````
<copy>
EXECUTE DS_TARGET_UTIL.GRANT_ROLE('DS$DATA_DISCOVERY_ROLE');
EXECUTE DS_TARGET_UTIL.GRANT_ROLE('DS$DATA_MASKING_ROLE');
EXECUTE DS_TARGET_UTIL.GRANT_ROLE('DS$AUDIT_SETTING_ROLE'); 
</copy>
````
