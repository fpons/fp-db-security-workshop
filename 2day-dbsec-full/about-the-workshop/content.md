# Database Security Solutions Workshop #

## Workshop Overview ##

This workshop addresses how to identify threats and remediate them by leveraging Oracle Database Security features. Oracle Database Security Options are an essential part of the Oracle strategy to protect data and sensitive information in Oracle Databases and offer ways to comply with recent Data Privacy regulations such as EU GDPR. The workshop covers most Oracle Database Security features and options and covers all topics related to the main rings of data protection: preventive, detective and monitoring. The materials are applicable to various database releases (11gR2 through to 19c). It is also valid wherever the database is deployed On-Premises or in the Oracle Cloud. It also covers Autonomous Database Security.
